                    <h3 class="text-center">For the sauce</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Prepare the sauce first so it has time to cool while you prepare the cheesecake. Sauce may be prepared up to 3 days in advance. <br>
                        In a small saucepan,combine 12oz raspberries, ¼ cup of sugar, ¼ cup of water, and 1 Tablespoon of lemon juice over medium/low heat. Stir frequently, and cook until the berries release their juices (will take several minutes).
                        </li>
                        <li>Increase heat to medium and bring mixture to a simmer while stirring constantly. Cook for several minutes until the berries break down and the sauce deepens in color and is slightly thickened (it will thicken only slightly).                          
                        </li>
                        <li>Remove from heat and pour through a fine mesh strainer into a heat proof bowl. Measure out 2 Tablespoons of your seeds left in the strainer (from the raspberries) and add them back to the sauce, discard the rest.                         
                        </li>
                        <li>Allow the mixture to cool while you prepare the crust and the cheesecake.                          
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </div>

                <div class="col-6 border-bottom border-danger border-4">
                    <h3 class="text-center">For the crust</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Preheat oven to 325F                         
                        </li>
                        <li>In a medium-sized bowl, stir together the 1½ cups of graham cracker crumbs, 2 Tablespoons of granulated sugar, and 1 Tablespoon of brown sugar. Add the melted butter until crumbs are all moistened.                     
                        </li>
                        <li>
                        Press the graham cracker mixture evenly into the bottom and up the sides of a 9” springform pan. Use the bottom of a glass or measuring cup to help you. Set crust aside as you prepare your cheesecake.
                        </li>
                    </ul>

                    <h3 class="text-center">For the Cheesecake</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Combine 24oz of cream cheese and 1cup of sugar in a large mixing bowl and use an electric mixer to stir together until smooth, creamy, and completely lump free.                     
                        </li>
                        <li>Add ½ cup of sour cream and 1 Teaspoon of vanilla extract into previous mixture and stir on low speed until combined.                       
                        </li>
                        <li>In a small bowl, lightly beat one egg and add it to the cheesecake batter, stirring on low speed until egg is just combined. Repeat with the remaining eggs, then scrape the sides and bottom of bowl to ensure all ingredients are thoroughly combined.                          
                        </li>
                    </ul>

                <div class="col-6 border-danger border-4">
                    <h3 class="text-center">For the Assembly</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Pour half of the cheesecake batter evenly over the prepared crust. Take about ⅓ cup of the cooled raspberry sauce and pour evenly over the batter.</li>
                        <li>Gently dollop the remaining cheesecake batter evenly over the raspberry sauce and smooth it with a spatula.</li>
                        <li>Drizzle with another ⅓ cup of raspberry sauce over the surface and use a toothpick or knife to swirl over the cheesecake. Reserve the rest of the sauce for serving (store covered in the refrigerator).</li>
                        <li>Transfer to center rack of 325F preheated oven for 45-55 minutes. The center of the cheesecake will be jiggly but the cheesecake should be mostly set.</li>
                        <li>When cheesecake is finished baking, turn off the oven, crack the door open a few inches and let cheesecake cool in the oven for 1 hour (this will help prevent cracks).</li>
                        <li>After 1 hour, remove from the oven and allow to cool at room temperature for an hour or until no longer warm. Once cooled, transfer to refrigerator to chill for at least 6 hours, preferably overnight.</li>
                        <li>Serve, topped with reserved raspberry sauce (we serve the raspberry sauce on the side so people can add as much or as little as they’d like).</li>
                    </ul>
